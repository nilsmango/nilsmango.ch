Project ReUse takes things that are not useful anymore, a.k.a. waste, and makes useful products, a.k.a. design out of them.  
Things created:
- PET bottle float (videolink)
- PET bottle lamp (concept only)
- Toilet paper roll art / Platonic bodies
- Laptop sleeves and simple wallets made from scrap leather from the furniture industry
- Surf poncho from old towels
