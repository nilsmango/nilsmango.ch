How to enroll in the Apple Developer Program in 7 easy steps:
1. Try with your private Apple ID and the iPhone or Mac app. Fail many times until they tell you they can’t enroll you.
2. Write to Apple Support (because the app tells you to do that), and they'll graciously get back to you saying they can't enroll you. But fear not! You can still use Xcode for your own projects.
3. Try enrolling again. And again. And again, until the app finally takes pity on you and stops letting you humiliate yourself.
4. Call Apple Support this time. They'll calmly inform you that they cannot enroll you, but you can still use Xcode for your own projects. The reason? "The system" says it can't enroll you. Any questions about possible alternative strategies will yield the same answer: you're denied an Apple developer account, but you can still use Xcode for yourself. Below is the actual footage of your phone call:

1. Go make a special Apple ID - use a random Gmail email address after failing with all your other email accounts.
2. Don’t use the apps; it's a trap! Go through the web on your computer (worked for me, at least).
3. Get the payment to go through and voila, it works! Simple as that!
