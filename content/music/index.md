I love making music, especially live and with other people. I am trying to take a minimalist approach to producing music. Using Ableton Live, few plugins, mostly stock, with only 1-2 hardware controllers or synths (Ableton Push mainly). Some hacked-together [Max for Live](/tags/maxforlive) devices are helping me to get experimental.

I have a couple of ways of making music:
- Minimalistic setup: just my MacBook running Ableton Live (used in Tracks on a Plane)
- Studio setup: MacBook running Ableton Live + Push
- Live setup: the studio setup combined with whatever other people bring.

You can download and/or listen to my music for free [below](#nils-mango).
