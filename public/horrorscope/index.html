 In 2011, when I was calling myself <a href="/megaduo">2000000</a> I had the idea to make a horrific horoscope, called horrorscope. I never managed to publish it to the interwebs and this masterpiece was lost to the world until I found it over 10 years later. The extremely sophisticated algorithm behind this special horoscope harnesses forces (yet to be found by science) of faraway stars and galaxies together with the spacetime of your birth to triangulate your future. Thank you, Pythagoras and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086017300691" target="_blank">Plimpton 322</a>!
